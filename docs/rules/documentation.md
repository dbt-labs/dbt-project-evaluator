## Documentation Coverage

??? example "`fct_documentation_coverage`"

```sql
--8<-- "models/marts/documentation/fct_documentation_coverage.sql"
```

`fct_documentation_coverage` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/documentation/fct_documentation_coverage.sql)) calculates the percent of enabled models in the project that have
a configured description.

This model will raise a `warn` error on a `dbt build` or `dbt test` if the `documentation_coverage_pct` is less than 100%.
You can set your own threshold by overriding the `documentation_coverage_target` variable. [See overriding variables section.](../customization/overriding-variables.md)

Good documentation for your dbt models will help downstream consumers discover and understand the datasets which you curate for them.
The documentation for your project includes model code, a DAG of your project, any tests you've added to a column, and more.

**How to Remediate**

Apply a text [description](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#related-documentation) in the model's `.yml` entry, or create a [docs block](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks) in a markdown file, and use the `{{ doc() }}`
function in the model's `.yml` entry.

!!! note "Tip"

We recommend that every model in your dbt project has at a minimum a model-level description. This ensures that each model's purpose is clear to other developers and stakeholders when viewing the dbt docs site.

## Undocumented Models

`fct_undocumented_models` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/documentation/fct_undocumented_models.sql)) lists every model with no description configured.

We recommend that every model in your dbt project has at minimum a model-level description. This ensures that each model's purpose is clear to other developers and stakeholders when viewing the dbt docs site. Missing documentation should be addressed first for marts models, then for the rest of your project, to ensure that stakeholders in the organization can understand the data which is surfaced to them.

## Undocumented Source Tables

`fct_undocumented_source_tables` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/documentation/fct_undocumented_source_tables.sql)) lists every source table with no description configured.

**Reason to Flag**

Good documentation for your dbt sources will help contributors to your project understand how and when data is loaded into your warehouse.

**How to Remediate**

Apply a text [description](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation) in the table's `.yml` entry, or create a [docs block](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks) in a markdown file, and use the `{{ doc() }}`
function in the table's `.yml` entry.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: my_source
    tables:
      - name: my_table
        description: This is the source table description
```

## Undocumented Sources

`fct_undocumented_sources` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/documentation/fct_undocumented_sources.sql)) lists every source with no description configured.

function in the source's `.yml` entry.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: my_source
    description: This is the source description
    tables:
      - name: my_table
```
