# Performance

## Chained View Dependencies

`fct_chained_views_dependencies`
([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/performance/fct_chained_views_dependencies.sql))
contains models that are dependent on chains of "non-physically materialized" models (views and ephemerals),
highlighting potential cases for improving performance by switching the materialization of model(s)
within the chain to table or incremental.

This model will raise a `warn` error on a `dbt build` or `dbt test` if the `distance`
between a given `parent` and `child` is greater than or equal to 4.
You can set your own threshold for chained views by overriding the `chained_views_threshold` variable.
[See overriding variables section.](../customization/overriding-variables.md)

### Example

`table_1` depends on a chain of 4 views (`view_1`, `view_2`, `view_3`, and `view_4`).

### Reason to Flag

You may experience a long runtime for a model when it is built on top of a long chain of "non-physically materialized"
models (views and ephemerals).
In the example above, nothing is really computed until you get to `table_1`.
At which point, it is going to run the query within `view_4`, which will then have to run the query within `view_3`,
which will then have the run the query within `view_2`, which will then have to run the query within `view_1`.
These will all be running at the same time, which creates a long runtime for `table_1`.

### How to Remediate

We can reduce this compilation time by changing the materialization strategy of some key upstream models
to table or incremental to keep a minimum amount of computing in memory and preventing nesting of views.
If, for example, we change the materialization of `view_4` from a view to a table,
`table_1` will have a shorter runtime as it will have less compilation to do.

The best practice to determine top candidates for changing materialization from `view` to `table`:

- if a view is used downstream my *many* models, change materialization to table
- if a view has more complex calculations (window functions, joins between *many* tables, etc.), change materialization to table

## Exposure Parents Materializations

`fct_exposure_parents_materializations`
([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-project-evaluator/tree/main/models/marts/performance/fct_exposure_parents_materializations.sql))
highlights instances where the resources referenced by exposures are either:

1. a `source`
2. a `model` that does not use the `table` or `incremental` materialization

### Example

![An example exposure with a table parent (fct_model_6) and an ephemeral parent (dim_model_7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73915542/178068955-742e2c87-4385-48f9-b9fb-94a1cbc8079a.png){ width=500 }

In this case, the parents of `exposure_1` are not both materialized as tables -- `dim_model_7` is ephemeral,
while `fct_model_6` is a table.
This model would return a record for the `dim_model_7 --> exposure_1` relationship.

### Reason to Flag

Exposures should depend on the business logic you encoded into your dbt project
(e.g., models or metrics) rather than raw untransformed sources.
Additionally, models that are referenced by an exposure are likely to be used heavily in downstream systems,
and therefore need to be performant when queried.

### How to Remediate

If you have a source parent of an exposure, you should incorporate that raw data into your project in some way,
then update the exposure to point to that model.

If necessary, update the `materialized` configuration on the models returned in `fct_exposure_parents_materializations`
to either `table` or `incremental`.
This can be done in individual model files using a config block, or for groups of models in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
See the docs on [model configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/model-configs) for more info!
