# Overriding Table Location

Similar to [configuring packages in general ](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/packages#configuring-packages),
you can change which schema (and database/catalog) the tables generated by this project will end up in.
This is done using the standard syntax in the `dbt_project.yaml` file.

```yaml
models:
  dbt_project_evaluator:
    +database: the_catalog_you_want
    +schema: the_schema_you_want
```

This can be done in the `dbt_project.yaml` file of the main project or the `dbt_project.yaml` file of the installed package.
Changes in the main project's file will override values and installed package's file.
If you don't provide any values,
the tables will end up in your project's default location.
