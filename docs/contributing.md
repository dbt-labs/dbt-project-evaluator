## Running docs locally

Docs are generated using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). To test them locally, run the following commands (use a Python virtual environment):

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Docs are then automatically pushed to the website as part of our CI/CD process. We use [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) as part of the process to publish different versions of the docs.

## Recommended VSCode extensions to help with writing docs

- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
  - Highlight issues with the Markdown code
- The config used in `.vscode/settings.json` is the following:

    ```json
    "markdownlint.config": {
        "ul-indent": {"indent": 4},
        "MD036": false,
        "MD046": false,
    }
    ```

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
  - Makes it easy to paste links on top of a text to create Markdown links
